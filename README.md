What was the problem/s you were solving in the projects for this course? 
The problems that I was tasked to solve in this course was finding the best data structure to use for ABCD University's course list, which turnt out, in the end, to be a hash table. 

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand. 
Before entering the development stage of my projects, I was tasked with writing an analysis of a few different data structure types. Creating an analysis paper allowed me to weigh the pros and cons of each data structure.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
The project introduced a multitude of problems for me. I was unfamiliar with many of the data structures introduced in this course, but I was able to get through it with the help of various tutors and the school provided materials. 

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs? 
I feel that my ability to produce high functioning code for different projects has increased significantly from where i started, as well as helped me glimpse into how code is made in a professional workplace. 

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I think all of these elements come from practice. I have written enough file streams that I now have a common function 
that I use as a prototype. I might even take a few of some other elements I keep reusing and develop them in to libraries.
